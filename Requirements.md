Requirements:
My project idea is a concierge agent that creates a custom weekly news summary/newsletter of topics I'm interested in and posts it to my WordPress blog.
The project must be built using Google ADK.
I want to specify specific sites and pages the agent should check for news updates.  Initially these can be just hard-coded in a project file but eventually I would like an admin interface so I can easily customize and update the list.
In addition, during the week I often run across articles on the web that interest me.  I bookmark these articles and never look at them again.  In addition to the regular sites the agent would check, I want to provide an input file with these links so the agent will check and summarize them in addition to the news.  Eventually I would like to provide these in an admin interface as well.  Maybe even via an Chrome browser extension.
I want to provide a list of topics of interest to me and somehow rank them for the agent.  Initially I am thinking each weekly summary would have about 20 news items so I need to help the agent prioritize what it finds.
I am visually driven.  I like Arstechnica.com because they usually have some type of visual element with each article.  Take a look here: https://arstechnica.com/  I am open to ideas on how to handle this… perhaps generate a photo or two with AI.  I don’t know that it makes sense to put a photo with every news item summary but perhaps a few.
I would like the summary written in my style.  I wrote every article on these two websites so they would be a good sample: https://mkfoster.com/ and https://fireflywp.com/
Each weekly summary should have a title “Mark’s Weekly Update:” followed by the date.  I.e., “Mark’s Weekly Update: November 28th, 2025”
Each weekly summary should also have an excerpt about 
Each summary should have a “featured” image captures the theme of that week in a 3:2 aspect ratio.  This will be posted to WordPress along with the article.
Each summary should contain a note that the content
The agent should:
Kick off on a weekly schedule
Check all the applicable websites
Pick the top 20 news items or articles prioritizing any bookmarks I have submitted for the week.
Write individual summaries for each item and cite/link sources.
Add images for each item.
Add a summary excerpt and featured image.
Post the summary and images to my WordPress site (initially this will be a private post)
Stretch goal: Create an audio podcast program based on the summary I can listen to in the car.
Stretch goal: Use Google Veo to generate subtle animations or videos around weekly themes.  I.e., an animated ai flow diagram if there is a lot of AI stuff happening that week.
Let me know if you see any opportunities for high value-add features I don’t have here.
